# IBM RAG and Agentic AI Professional Certificate [🔗](https://coursera.org/share/6ae538b1911816816ea00a86edbca8b7)

## 📌 Overview
The **IBM RAG and Agentic AI Professional Certificate** program offered on Coursera is an advanced specialization designed to provide deep expertise in **Generative AI, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and Agentic AI systems**. It is tailored for developers and AI practitioners who want to build autonomous, context-aware AI applications that go beyond simple chatbots to perform complex multi-step tasks.

Throughout this program, I completed a rigorous curriculum that focused on orchestrating Large Language Models (LLMs) with external tools, vector databases, and multi-agent frameworks to create intelligent, production-ready systems.

## 📚 What I Learned
- Building sophisticated RAG pipelines to ground LLM responses in real-time, proprietary data
- Orchestrating single and multi-agent workflows using LangChain and LangGraph
- Developing autonomous agentic systems capable of planning, reasoning, and tool calling
- Implementing vector databases like ChromaDB and FAISS for semantic search and memory
- Creating multimodal AI applications that process text, images, and audio simultaneously
- Deploying AI agents and applications using web frameworks like Flask and Gradio

## 🛠️ Key Skills Gained
