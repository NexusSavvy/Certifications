# Assets, Threats, and Vulnerabilities [🔗](https://coursera.org/share/e3b71cfe4a939df76ebb4da0fe39c76c)

Master the defense of digital strongholds — this course provided a critical examination of cybersecurity from the perspective of both the defender and the attacker, focusing on how to secure valuable assets against an ever-evolving landscape of threats.

## 📚 Course Overview

This course offered a comprehensive framework for risk management, emphasizing the vital practice of asset classification and protection. It moved beyond basic security concepts to practical applications, teaching how to implement the NIST Cybersecurity Framework and utilize industry-standard threat modeling methodologies like PASTA. Learners developed an "attacker mindset" to proactively identify vulnerabilities in systems, moving from reactive defense to strategic, intelligence-driven security operations.

## 🧠 Key Skills Acquired

- **Asset Classification**: Categorizing information and resources based on value and sensitivity
- **Threat Modeling**: Application of the PASTA framework (Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis)
- **Vulnerability Management**: Identifying and mitigating common exposures like those in the OWASP Top 10
- **Cryptographic Fundamentals**: Understanding encryption (symmetric/asymmetric) and hashing for data integrity
- **Access Control**: Implementing robust authentication and authorization protocols (e.g., MFA, SSO)
- **Risk Assessment**: Evaluating likelihood and severity to prioritize security controls
- **Security Frameworks**: Applying the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) to manage organizational risk

## 🌍 Real-World Applications

The skills and knowledge gained through this course can be applied to:

- **Enterprise Risk Management**: conducting audits to identify unpatched systems and shadow IT
- **Secure System Design**: using threat modeling to build security into applications during the development phase
- **Data Protection Compliance**: ensuring PII and sensitive business data are encrypted and access-controlled
- **Incident Prevention**: reducing the attack surface by disabling unnecessary services and ports
- **Vulnerability Remediation**: prioritizing patches based on the criticality of assets and active threat intelligence
- **Social Engineering Defense**: training teams to recognize and report phishing and persuasion tactics

This course was a fundamental pillar in understanding the "why" and "how" of protecting modern digital infrastructure!
