# Fundamentals of Building AI Agents [🔗](https://coursera.org/share/084b46a9e761fe8879c725c7dfc593e2)

Transform LLMs from passive text generators into active problem solvers — this course provided a hands-on foundation in designing AI agents that can reason, execute code, and interact with the real world using tools and data.

## 📚 Course Overview

This course offered a technical deep dive into the architecture of agentic systems, moving beyond standard prompting to "tool use" and "chaining" patterns. It emphasized the practical implementation of **LangChain** and **LangChain Expression Language (LCEL)** to connect Large Language Models (LLMs) to external calculators, APIs, and databases. Learners gained experience in building both manual and automated tool-calling pipelines, culminating in the creation of specialized agents capable of math, data analysis, and SQL querying.

## 🧠 Key Skills Acquired

- **Tool Calling & Orchestration**: Enabling LLMs to select and execute the right tools for a given task
- **LangChain Expression Language (LCEL)**: Constructing composable chains to link prompts, models, and output parsers
- **Manual vs. Automated Tooling**: Understanding when to let the model decide versus enforcing strict control flows
- **Structured Output Parsing**: Converting natural language responses into executable formats (e.g., JSON, SQL)
- **SQL Agent Implementation**: Building agents that can query relational databases using natural language
- **Data Visualization Automation**: Creating agents that analyze datasets and generate charts on demand
- **Agent Evaluation**: Testing state-action mappings and validating tool usage accuracy

## 🌍 Real-World Applications

The skills and knowledge gained through this course can be applied to:

- **AI Math Assistants**: Building reliable solvers that offload calculation to Python or calculator tools
- **Conversational Database Interfaces**: Allowing non-technical users to query complex SQL databases via chat
- **Automated Data Analysts**: Developing bots that take a CSV file and output key insights and graphs automatically
- **Smart API Connectors**: Creating systems that can fetch real-time weather, stock prices, or booking info
- **Workflow Automation**: designing agents that trigger specific business actions (e.g., sending emails, updating CRM) based on chat context
- **Dynamic Decision Systems**: Engineering apps that plan a multi-step approach to solve user problems independently

This course was the crucial first step in bridging the gap between a "chatbot" and a truly intelligent "copilot"!
