# Tools of the Trade: Linux and SQL [🔗](https://coursera.org/share/745f9eabaa400629b7f3ab22a0959871)

Equip yourself with the essential digital toolbelt of a cybersecurity professional — this course provided a hands-on mastery of the Linux operating system and Structured Query Language (SQL), the two most critical technical skills for analyzing and securing modern data infrastructure.

## 📚 Course Overview

This course offered a practical, foundational deep dive into the technical environments where security analysts live and breathe. It moved beyond graphical interfaces to the power of the command line, teaching how to navigate the Linux file system, manage user permissions, and manipulate data directly through the Bash shell. Simultaneously, it demystified database management, enabling learners to write SQL queries to retrieve, filter, and join critical information from vast datasets to support security investigations.

## 🧠 Key Skills Acquired

- **Linux Navigation**: Using Bash commands to traverse file systems and manage directories
- **Access Control Management**: Configuring file permissions (chmod) and user authorization
- **Command Line Proficiency**: executing core commands like `ls`, `grep`, and `sudo` for efficient system interaction
- **SQL Querying**: Writing standard SQL statements (`SELECT`, `FROM`, `WHERE`) to pull specific data
- **Data Filtering & Logic**: Using operators (AND, OR, NOT) and filters to pinpoint relevant security logs
- **Database Joins**: Combining data from multiple tables to reveal complex relationships and insights
- **OS Architecture**: Understanding the differences between Graphical User Interfaces (GUI) and Command Line Interfaces (CLI)

## 🌍 Real-World Applications

The skills and knowledge gained through this course can be applied to:

- **Security Log Analysis**: using `grep` to instantly filter through thousands of server logs for suspicious activity
- **User Auditing**: verifying and modifying user permissions to enforce the principle of least privilege
- **Incident Investigation**: querying database records to trace the timeline of a potential data breach
- **Server Hardening**: managing software packages and updates directly from the Linux terminal
- **Data Forensics**: retrieving and joining disparate pieces of evidence from relational databases to build a case
- **Automated Monitoring**: writing basic shell scripts to check system status and file integrity

This course was the definitive toolkit for building the technical confidence needed to navigate and protect the backend of the digital world!
