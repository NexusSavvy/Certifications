# Build Multimodal Generative AI Applications [🔗](https://coursera.org/share/c736e5f5d26131150fa99977c451c60a)

Break the barriers between text, image, and sound — this course provided a hands-on guide to engineering next-generation AI systems that can see, hear, and speak by integrating state-of-the-art multimodal models.

## 📚 Course Overview

This course offered a practical, project-based approach to building full-stack multimodal applications, moving beyond single-mode text processing to complex workflows involving vision, speech, and video. It emphasized the integration of powerful models like OpenAI's Whisper, DALL·E, Meta's Llama, and IBM's Granite into interactive web interfaces using Gradio and Flask. Learners gained the expertise to construct sophisticated pipelines for tasks ranging from automated image captioning to cross-modal retrieval and generative storytelling.
