# Advanced RAG with Vector Databases and Retrievers [🔗](https://coursera.org/share/c08b2c43b4641c44fc00b9a1a317eb54)

Master the architecture of intelligent search systems — this course provided a technical deep dive into building production-grade Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) applications using state-of-the-art vector databases and retrieval strategies.

## 📚 Course Overview

This course offered a comprehensive exploration of the mechanisms behind high-performance RAG systems, moving beyond basic similarity search to advanced retrieval patterns. It emphasized the practical implementation of vector databases like FAISS and Chroma DB, teaching how to optimize retrieval for relevance and speed. Learners gained hands-on experience integrating these databases with LangChain and LlamaIndex to build sophisticated AI applications, culminating in the creation of a fully functional RAG-powered app with a Gradio interface.

## 🧠 Key Skills Acquired

- **Vector Database Management**: Implementation and indexing with FAISS and Chroma DB
- **Advanced Retrieval Patterns**: Utilizing multi-query, parent document, and self-querying retrievers
- **RAG Pipeline Orchestration**: Building end-to-end pipelines using LangChain and LlamaIndex
- **Semantic Search Optimization**: Applying Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) algorithms for efficient similarity search
- **UI Integration**: Developing interactive front-end interfaces for AI apps using Gradio
- **Retrieval Evaluation**: Assessing model performance and retrieval quality
- **Contextual compression and filtering**: Optimizing the context window for LLMs

## 🌍 Real-World Applications

The skills and knowledge gained through this course can be applied to:

- **Enterprise Knowledge Management**: Building internal search engines that retrieve precise documents from vast repositories
- **Intelligent Customer Support**: developing chatbots that answer queries with high factual accuracy using company data
- **Content Recommendation Engines**: Creating systems that suggest relevant articles or media based on semantic similarity
- **Automated Summarization Tools**: Building apps that retrieve and condense long-form content into concise summaries
- **Legal and Medical Research**: Enhancing information retrieval for professionals needing exact and context-aware results
- **Dynamic Question-Answering Systems**: Constructing real-time QA tools that adapt to user intent through query expansion

This course was a critical milestone in advancing my ability to engineer scalable, context-aware AI solutions!
