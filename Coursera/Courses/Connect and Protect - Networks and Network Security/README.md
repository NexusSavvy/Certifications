# Connect and Protect: Networks and Network Security [🔗](https://coursera.org/share/e85cb5cca389b519aa504ba5b00164a0)

Master the digital highways — this course provided a critical understanding of how the internet functions and the defensive strategies needed to secure the networks that connect our world.

## 📚 Course Overview

This course offered a comprehensive dive into network architecture and operations, deconstructing the TCP/IP and OSI models to explain exactly how data flows across the internet. It emphasized the "security mindset," teaching how to identify vulnerabilities—such as packet sniffing and Denial of Service (DoS) attacks—and how to implement robust defenses including firewalls, VPNs, and system hardening techniques.

## 🧠 Key Skills Acquired

- **Network Architecture Analysis**: Understanding the layers of the TCP/IP and OSI models
- **Packet Capture & Analysis**: Using tools like `tcpdump` and Wireshark to inspect network traffic
- **Network Defense Implementation**: Configuring firewalls, VPNs, and Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)
- **Threat Identification**: Recognizing common attacks like DDoS, IP Spoofing, and Man-in-the-Middle (MITM)
- **System Hardening**: Applying security best practices to Operating Systems to reduce attack surfaces
- **Cloud Security Fundamentals**: Understanding how network security principles apply to cloud environments
- **Protocol Knowledge**: detailed understanding of TCP, UDP, IP, DNS, and HTTP protocols

## 🌍 Real-World Applications

The skills and knowledge gained through this course can be applied to:

- **Intrusion Detection**: Analyzing network logs to detect anomalies and potential breaches in real-time
- **Secure Remote Access**: Setting up Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) to protect data in transit
- **Incident Mitigation**: responding effectively to Denial of Service (DoS) attacks to maintain service availability
- **Network Design**: Architecting secure local (LAN) and wide area networks (WAN) with proper segmentation
- **Vulnerability Management**: Hardening systems against brute force attacks and known exploits
- **Connectivity Troubleshooting**: Diagnosing network issues by tracing protocol handshakes and data flow

This course was a crucial milestone in understanding the infrastructure of the internet and how to defend it!
