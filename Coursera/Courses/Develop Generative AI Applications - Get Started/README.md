# Develop Generative AI Applications: Get Started [🔗](https://coursera.org/share/f3098511361a856aa66aee8a6a2f0efe)

Transition from concept to code by building your own intelligent software — this course provided a hands-on roadmap for engineering full-stack generative AI applications using Python and industry-standard frameworks.

## 📚 Course Overview

This course offered a practical, project-driven approach to application development, moving beyond simple prompting to the architectural design of AI systems. It emphasized the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) like Llama 3 and IBM Granite into functional web apps using Flask and Gradio. Learners gained critical experience with the LangChain framework to orchestrate complex workflows, manage prompt templates, and build capable AI agents that can interact with users and external data.

## 🧠 Key Skills Acquired

- **Application Development**: Building and deploying GenAI web apps using Flask and Gradio
- **LangChain Orchestration**: Mastering chains, agents, and tools to create complex AI logic
- **Prompt Engineering**: Implementing advanced techniques like Chain-of-Thought and In-Context Learning
- **Model Selection**: Evaluating and comparing models (Llama 3, Granite, Mixtral) for specific use cases
- **Structured Output Parsing**: Handling JSON responses to ensure reliable application behavior
- **Prompt Template Management**: Creating reusable and dynamic templates for consistent model interaction
- **Python Programming**: Writing backend logic to bridge user inputs with LLM capabilities

## 🌍 Real-World Applications

The skills and knowledge gained through this course can be applied to:

- **Custom Chatbot Creation**: Developing specialized assistants that run on specific backend logic
- **Intelligent Web Portals**: Building customer-facing interfaces that leverage AI for real-time support
- **Automated Content Generators**: Creating tools that draft, format, and polish text based on user parameters
- **Data Extraction Tools**: Engineering apps that parse complex documents and output structured data (JSON)
- **Workflow Automation**: Orchestrating multi-step tasks where AI agents decide the sequence of actions
- **Model Benchmarking**: Systematically testing different LLMs to find the most cost-effective solution for a business problem

This course was the bridge between understanding AI theory and actually building the software that powers the future!
