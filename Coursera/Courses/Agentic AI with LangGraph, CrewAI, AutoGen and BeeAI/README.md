# Agentic AI with LangGraph, CrewAI, AutoGen and BeeAI [🔗](https://coursera.org/share/c23eac74577e1f6c481569f7d155f859)

Master the frontier of autonomous software — this course provided a comprehensive guide to designing and orchestrating multi-agent systems using the industry's most powerful frameworks for building scalable, intelligent applications.

## 📚 Course Overview

This course offered a structured approach to agentic design, teaching how to move beyond simple LLM calls to building complex ecosystems where AI agents plan, collaborate, and execute tasks. It focused on selecting the right framework for the job—leveraging **LangGraph** for graph-based control, **CrewAI** for role-based orchestration, **BeeAI** for enterprise-grade production agents, and **AG2 (formerly AutoGen)** for conversational workflows. Learners gained hands-on experience in defining agent roles, managing stateful memory, and implementing human-in-the-loop patterns to ensure reliability in autonomous systems.

## 🧠 Key Skills Acquired

- **LangGraph Workflow Design**: Creating stateful, cyclic graphs with nodes and edges to control complex agent behaviors
- **Role-Based Orchestration**: Configuring specialized agents with specific goals and backstories using CrewAI
- **Multi-Agent Collaboration**: Implementing conversation patterns and group chats for agents to solve problems jointly using AutoGen (AG2)
- **Enterprise Agent Deployment**: Building production-ready, constraint-compliant agents with BeeAI
- **Structured Output Generation**: Using Pydantic and YAML to enforce strict data formats across agent communications
- **Tool Use & Function Calling**: Equipping agents with custom tools to interact with APIs, databases, and the web
- **Human-in-the-Loop Integration**: setting up checkpoints and approval steps to maintain oversight of autonomous actions

## 🌍 Real-World Applications

The skills and knowledge gained through this course can be applied to:

- **Automated Research Teams**: Orchestrating a "crew" of agents to browse the web, synthesize data, and write comprehensive reports
- **Intelligent Customer Support**: deploying conversational swarms that route tickets and resolve issues collaboratively
- **Software Development Assistants**: Building agents that write, debug, and review code in an iterative loop
- **Healthcare Chatbots**: Creating secure, domain-specific assistants that adhere to strict interaction protocols
- **Supply Chain Optimization**: Automating logistics planning by coordinating agents responsible for inventory, routing, and scheduling
- **Financial Analysis**: Deploying multi-agent systems to analyze market trends and generate investment insights autonomously

This course was a definitive guide to moving from "chatbots" to true "agentic" systems that can independently get work done!
