# Sound the Alarm: Detection and Response [🔗](https://coursera.org/share/a93d4892d29abc42f67fe07d85a2a5ac)

Master the art of digital vigilance — this course provided a hands-on deep dive into the "detect" and "respond" phases of cybersecurity, teaching the critical skills needed to spot active threats and neutralize them before damage occurs.

## 📚 Course Overview

This course offered a comprehensive exploration of the incident response lifecycle, moving beyond theory to the practical application of industry-standard tools for threat hunting and analysis. It emphasized the "detective" work of cybersecurity, training learners to sniff network traffic with Wireshark, analyze logs with SIEM platforms like Splunk and Chronicle, and configure Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) using Suricata. Learners gained the expertise to distinguish between false positives and true threats, ensuring rapid and effective responses to security incidents.

## 🧠 Key Skills Acquired

- **Incident Response Lifecycle**: Applying the NIST framework (Preparation, Detection & Analysis, Containment, Eradication & Recovery, Post-Incident Activity)
- **Packet Analysis**: capturing and inspecting network traffic using **Wireshark** and **tcpdump**
- **SIEM Operations**: Querying and analyzing logs using **Splunk** and **Google Chronicle** to investigate events
- **Intrusion Detection**: Writing and interpreting signatures/rules for **Suricata** (IDS)
- **Log Analysis**: Interpreting system and network logs to identify anomalies and indicators of compromise (IOCs)
- **Triage & Verification**: Distinguishing between true/false positives and prioritizing alerts based on severity
- **Documentation**: Maintaining incident handler journals and establishing chain of custody for evidence

## 🌍 Real-World Applications

The skills and knowledge gained through this course can be applied to:

- **Network Forensics**: dissecting packet captures (PCAPs) to understand exactly how an attack occurred
- **SOC Operations**: Monitoring real-time dashboards and validating security alerts in a Security Operations Center
- **Threat Hunting**: Proactively querying SIEM data to find hidden threats that bypassed initial defenses
- **Incident Reporting**: Drafting comprehensive post-incident reports that detail the "who, what, when, and how" of a breach
- **Playbook Execution**: Following structured procedures to contain specific threats like phishing or malware outbreaks
- **Rule Configuration**: Tuning IDS signatures to detect new and evolving attack patterns effectively

This course was a transformative experience in learning how to act fast and think critically when the digital alarm bells start ringing!
