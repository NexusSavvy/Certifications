# Network Traffic Analysis with Wireshark [🔗](https://coursera.org/share/d9bd0dfb8eefb8e540ec2635515f1902)

Decode the digital pulse of your network—this course provided a masterclass in deep packet inspection and protocol analysis using the industry-standard tool, Wireshark.

## 📚 Course Overview

This course offered a comprehensive exploration of network protocols and traffic behavior through the lens of Wireshark.  It bridged the gap between theoretical networking concepts and practical troubleshooting, teaching how to capture, filter, and inspect data packets to diagnose performance issues and security anomalies with precision.

## 🧠 Key Skills Acquired

- Proficient navigation of the Wireshark interface and configuration of profiles
- Capturing traffic in promiscuous mode and interpreting PCAP files
- Mastering display filters and capture filters (BPF syntax) to isolate relevant data
- Deep analysis of the TCP/IP stack and the 3-way handshake mechanism
- Reconstructing and following TCP/UDP streams to view application-layer data
- Identifying network latency, packet loss, and retransmissions
- Analyzing common protocols such as HTTP, DNS, DHCP, and FTP for errors

## 🌍 Real-World Applications

The skills and knowledge gained through this course can be applied to:

- Troubleshooting slow network performance and connectivity drops
- Investigating security incidents by analyzing suspicious traffic patterns
- Detecting malware command-and-control communications
- Validating firewall rules and network configurations
- Debugging application errors by inspecting API calls and server responses
- Conducting forensic analysis to reconstruct user activity on the network

This course was an illuminating journey into the invisible infrastructure that powers our connected world!
