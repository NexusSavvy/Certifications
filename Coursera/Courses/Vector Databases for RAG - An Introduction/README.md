# Vector Databases for RAG - An Introduction [🔗](https://coursera.org/share/3911e43d3426e073e868014c29d95946)

Unlock the long-term memory of Artificial Intelligence — this course provided a hands-on guide to the backbone of modern AI, teaching how to store, index, and retrieve data to build powerful Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems.

## 📚 Course Overview

This course offered a comprehensive exploration of vector databases, establishing why they are the critical "missing link" for generative AI applications. It moved beyond traditional relational database concepts to the world of high-dimensional vectors, teaching how to capture semantic meaning and perform efficient similarity searches. Learners gained practical experience with **Chroma DB**, mastering the ingestion of data, the creation of embeddings using Hugging Face models, and the construction of recommendation engines that power intelligent, context-aware applications.

## 🧠 Key Skills Acquired

- **Vector Database Management**: creating and managing collections using Chroma DB
- **Semantic Search**: Implementing similarity search algorithms like Cosine Similarity and Euclidean Distance
- **RAG Architecture**: Understanding how to ground LLMs with external proprietary data to prevent hallucinations
- **Data Embedding**: transforming text into vector representations using Hugging Face models
- **Recommendation System Design**: Building engines that suggest content based on semantic proximity rather than keywords
- **Python for AI**: Writing scripts to ingest data, query vector stores, and filter results
- **Database CRUD Operations**: Performing Create, Read, Update, and Delete actions within a vector environment

## 🌍 Real-World Applications

The skills and knowledge gained through this course can be applied to:

- **RAG-Powered Chatbots**: Building customer support agents that answer based solely on company policy documents
- **Personalized Recommendation Engines**: Developing systems that suggest movies, products, or food based on user preferences
- **Semantic Search Portals**: upgrading enterprise search to understand the "intent" behind a query, not just the keywords
- **Content Discovery**: Creating tools that find relevant articles or research papers based on thematic similarity
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identifying outliers in data by finding vectors that are distant from the norm
- **Long-Term AI Memory**: Giving LLMs the ability to recall past interactions or vast datasets instantly

This course was the definitive first step in mastering the infrastructure that makes AI truly useful and knowledgeable!
