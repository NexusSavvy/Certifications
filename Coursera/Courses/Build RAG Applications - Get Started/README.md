# Build RAG Applications: Get Started [🔗](https://coursera.org/share/a19e988973950c394d6b340885d24a5e)

Bridge the gap between static data and generative AI — this course provided a hands-on introduction to building Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems that ground LLM responses in verifiable, proprietary data.

## 📚 Course Overview

This course offered a practical, project-based approach to the RAG framework, teaching how to augment Large Language Models (LLMs) with external knowledge sources. It moved beyond basic theory to the actual construction of AI applications, utilizing powerful tools like LangChain and LlamaIndex to manage document retrieval and embedding. Learners gained experience in deploying interactive web interfaces with Gradio, creating end-to-end pipelines that ingest, index, and query private documents for accurate, context-aware answers.

## 🧠 Key Skills Acquired

- **RAG Architecture Design**: Understanding the workflow of retrieving and injecting context into LLMs
- **Vector Database Implementation**: Using Chroma DB and FAISS for efficient similarity search and storage
- **Orchestration Frameworks**: Building retrieval chains and agents using LangChain and LlamaIndex
- **Document Processing**: Splitting, chunking, and embedding text data for optimal retrieval
- **User Interface Development**: Creating interactive front-ends for AI apps using Gradio
- **Prompt Engineering**: Designing templates to effectively combine user queries with retrieved context
- **Model Integration**: connecting LLMs (like Granite or GPT models) to custom knowledge bases

## 🌍 Real-World Applications

The skills and knowledge gained through this course can be applied to:

- **Private Document Q&A Bots**: Building secure chatbots that answer questions based solely on internal company files
- **Customer Support Automation**: Creating systems that instantly retrieve policy details or troubleshooting steps for agents
- **Legal and Medical Research**: Developing tools to search and summarize vast libraries of case law or medical journals
- **Educational Tutors**: Engineering AI assistants that answer student queries using specific textbook content
- **Interactive Knowledge Bases**: transforming static FAQs into dynamic, conversational search experiences
- **Semantic Search Engines**: enhancing traditional keyword search with understanding of user intent and context

This course was a foundational step in mastering the ability to build AI that knows what *you* know!
