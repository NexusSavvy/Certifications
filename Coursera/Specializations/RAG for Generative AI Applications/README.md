# RAG for Generative AI Applications [🔗](https://coursera.org/share/2a707c85f3d251d780f49a6e6ec7c5f7)

## 📄 Description
The **RAG for Generative AI Applications** course, offered by **DeepLearning.AI**, is a technical program that dives deep into the architecture of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). It covers the end-to-end pipeline of connecting LLMs to proprietary data, equipping learners with the ability to build grounded, accurate, and context-aware AI applications.

This course helped me gain a solid understanding of vector search and retrieval strategies and apply them to real-world problems using vector databases and advanced prompting techniques.

## 📚 What I Learned
- Core concepts of RAG architecture (Retrieval, Augmentation, Generation)
- Building and optimizing vector search pipelines using embeddings
- Improving system performance through advanced retrieval techniques (e.g., hybrid search, reranking)
- Working with vector databases to manage and query large-scale knowledge bases
- Understanding of practical aspects such as chunking strategies and handling context window limits

## 🛠️ Key Skills Gained
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Vector Databases (e.g., Pinecone, Chroma, Weaviate)
- Semantic Search & Embeddings
- Prompt Engineering for RAG
- Data Chunking & Preprocessing
- LangChain & LlamaIndex

## 🌍 Real-World Applications
- Building "Chat with your Data" applications for enterprise documents
- Developing customer service bots with access to up-to-date knowledge bases
- Creating semantic search engines for specialized domains (legal, medical)
- Enhancing LLM accuracy and reducing hallucinations in production systems
