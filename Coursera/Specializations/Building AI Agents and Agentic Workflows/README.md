# Building AI Agents and Agentic Workflows [🔗](https://coursera.org/share/2fd98e94e677eceed717401ac5b09ccd)

## 📄 Description
The **Building AI Agents and Agentic Workflows** specialization, developed by **IBM** and offered on **Coursera**, is a comprehensive program that explores the cutting-edge field of agentic AI. It covers the design and orchestration of autonomous agents, equipping learners with the ability to build multi-agent systems that can plan, reason, and collaborate to solve complex workflows.

This course helped me gain a solid understanding of agentic design patterns and apply them to real-world problems using modern frameworks like LangGraph, CrewAI, and AutoGen.

## 📚 What I Learned
- Core concepts of Agentic AI, including reflection, reasoning, and tool use
- Building structured multi-agent systems that collaborate using orchestration frameworks
- Implementing self-improving agents capable of iterative refinement
- Working with Agentic RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) for advanced data retrieval
- Understanding of practical aspects such as human-in-the-loop interaction and memory management

## 🛠️ Key Skills Gained
- Multi-Agent Orchestration
- LangGraph & LangChain
- CrewAI & AutoGen (AG2)
- BeeAI Framework
- Agentic Design Patterns
- Python & API Integration

## 🌍 Real-World Applications
- Automating complex business workflows with autonomous agents
- Building collaborative AI teams for research and data analysis
- Developing intelligent customer support bots with reasoning capabilities
- Creating personalized scheduling and planning assistants
